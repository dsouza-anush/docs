Vibes ships with a library of interactive widgets so generated apps feel like real products, not static mockups. You can extend these widgets or introduce your own components when you refine the app post-transfer.

## Built-in patterns

| Widget | Use cases |
| --- | --- |
| **Interactive map** | Visualize store locations, delivery zones, or service coverage with zoom and tooltips. |
| **Image carousel** | Highlight feature screenshots, product photos, or design mockups. |
| **Photo album** | Display grid galleries with lightbox navigation. |
| **Scrollable list** | Present search results or structured records with sorting and filters. |
| **Video player** | Embed how-to videos or product demos directly in the generated page. |

Each widget is implemented with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so you can enrich them after transferring the project.

## Customize prompts

To influence widget selection, include cues in your prompt:

- “Show nearby clinics on a map.”
- “Add a carousel with three customer testimonials.”
- “Create a pricing table with cards for Starter and Pro tiers.”

Vibes chooses the closest widget pattern and populates placeholder content that you can refine later.

## Reference implementation

The [pizzaz-mcp-heroku](https://github.com/dsouza-anush/pizzaz-mcp-heroku) repository demonstrates the full widget stack—MCP server, manifest, and front-end components. Use it as a blueprint when designing custom widgets.

### Key files

- `/widgets/*.html` – iframe HTML for each widget.
- `/widgets/static/*` – CSS and JavaScript assets.
- `/server/tools/*.py` – MCP tool definitions that return widget metadata.

## After transfer

Once the app lives in your Heroku account you can:

- Replace placeholder data with content from your database or APIs.
- Swap the widget framework for your preferred component library (React, Vue, etc.).
- Add analytics or event tracking to understand user interaction with widgets.

Widgets are a quick way to demonstrate value during prototyping. Treat them as starting points—enhance them as you productize the generated app.
