Heroku Vibes is the umbrella for the tone, rituals, and human-in-the-loop practices that make every assistant feel on-brand. Use these guidelines to launch new experiences that sound like Heroku—whether you’re building support copilots, onboarding guides, or dashboard helpers.

## What is a vibe?

A vibe captures three ingredients:

1. **Voice** – the words and sentence structure you want the model to use.
2. **Values** – the behaviours the assistant must uphold (accuracy, transparency, empathy).
3. **Rituals** – repeatable moments that reinforce the brand (celebrating deploys, nudging best practices).

Combining all three helps teams ship consistent assistants without re-writing the same instructions each time.

## How to capture your vibe

<Steps>
<Step title="Document intent and audience">
  Outline what the assistant is responsible for, who it helps, and the outcomes that define success.
</Step>
<Step title="Write a core prompt">
  Use the [tone library](/heroku-vibes/tone-library) to assemble a system message that includes voice, values, rituals, and red lines.
</Step>
<Step title="Collect signature phrases">
  Add example sentences or callouts (e.g., “Heads up, this runs on a one-off dyno”) that the assistant can reuse when appropriate.
</Step>
<Step title="Publish the vibe">
  Store your prompt, sample conversations, and evaluation checklist in version control so every team can adopt it.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Evaluating vibes

Revisit the prompt whenever:

- Accuracy starts slipping or the assistant overpromises.
- New product launches require different rituals (e.g., calling out AI Studio features).
- Customer support teams request tone adjustments (more direct? more celebratory?).

Use lightweight graders (see the [prompt patterns cookbook](/cookbook/prompt-patterns)) to keep tone and policy compliance measurable in CI and post-deployment.

## Next steps

- Explore the [tone library](/heroku-vibes/tone-library) for plug-and-play system snippets.
- Align with the [prompt patterns cookbook](/cookbook/prompt-patterns) to audit prompts before rollout.
- Revisit vibes quarterly with product, CX, and marketing partners to ensure they still match our customers’ expectations.
