Heroku Vibes is an asynchronous agent that helps you build apps on Heroku. Use Heroku Vibes to generate apps from conversational prompts, enabling you to go from idea to fully-deployed app in minutes. The assistant provides an intuitive, guided experience that abstracts away the complexities of modern app development. Whether you’re an experienced developer or new to coding, you can use Heroku Vibes to increase your productivity and efficiency.

This article guides you through using Heroku Vibes, from generating an app to transferring it to your own Heroku account.

> note
> Heroku Vibes is currently in pilot. The products offered as part of the pilot aren’t intended for production use and are considered as a Beta Service and are subject to the Beta Services terms at [https://www.salesforce.com/company/legal/agreements.jsp](https://www.salesforce.com/company/legal/agreements.jsp).

## Benefits

Heroku Vibes benefits new and experienced developers:

- **New developers**: Build functional apps without getting stuck in technical details. Vibes is your launchpad for learning and creating.
- **Experienced developers**: Bypass the repetitive setup and configuration. Use Vibes to prototype rapidly and spend more time on your project's unique challenges.

## Quick start

1. Go to [vibes.heroku.com](https://vibes.heroku.com).
2. Sign in with Heroku or a Google account.
3. Describe the app you want to build.
4. Review the app in the right panel and click **Open App** to see the app.

## Getting started

Before you can start building, log in to a Heroku account or Google account by clicking **Sign In**.

- **Existing Heroku users**: Log in directly with your existing Heroku account.
- **New users**: Either sign up for a new Heroku account, or log in with your Google account.

## How it works

Heroku Vibes acts as your AI assistant. You provide the details, and it generates your app.

### 1. Create your app with a prompt

Start by describing the application you want to build in plain English. The more descriptive you are, the better. For example:

- “Build a simple blog application using Node.js and a PostgreSQL database.”
- “I need a Python Flask API for a to-do list.”
- “Create a basic Ruby on Rails app that displays a welcome message.”

After you enter your prompt, Vibes spins up a dyno and creates a to-do list to track the implementation, so you can follow along every step of the way.

### 2. Review your app

After the generation is complete, you can find your app in the right panel. From here, you can preview the app in preview mode or click **Open App** to view it in a webpage.

### 3. Verify your account

During the pilot, Vibes creates your app in a temporary Heroku account. When you're ready to take full control, you can transfer it to your personal Heroku account.

Before transferring, you must verify your Heroku account. A verified account also gives you 30 free messages per week. The verification process is free, and you’re not charged. To verify, click **Get Verified** in the top right and then **Verify Account**.

- **Existing Heroku users**: Log in to authorize the connection. Then, add a payment method if you haven’t added one to verify your account.
- **New users**: We guide you through creating a Heroku account and adding a payment method to verify your account.

### 4. Transfer your app

After verifying, click **Transfer to Heroku**. When prompted provide the Heroku account you want to transfer your app to. After transferring, you can manage the app from your standard Heroku Dashboard, such as scaling dynos, adding custom domains, viewing logs, and editing the code to continue its development. To download your app's code, run:

```bash
heroku git:clone -a APP-NAME
```

Transferring your app to your Heroku account adds one Basic dyno to your app, which costs $7 per month. Standard pricing and terms apply after transferring your app.

### 5. Delete a project

If you no longer need one of your projects or are out of project slots, you can delete one by clicking the Delete icon on the project page.

## Extend your apps with add-ons

You can provision add-ons like databases and caching services by including them in your [initial prompt](#1-create-your-app-with-a-prompt).

### Attaching Heroku Postgres

To add a Postgres database, mention it in your request. Vibes automatically provisions the database, attaches it to your app, and sets the `DATABASE_URL` config var.

Example prompts:

- “Build a guestbook application that saves messages from visitors.”
- “Create a Go web server and attach a `standard-0` Heroku Postgres database.”

### Attaching Heroku Key-Value Store

You can also add a Key-Value Store instance. Vibes provisions the add-on and configures the `REDIS_URL` for your application.

Example prompts:

- “Create a simple polling app that shows vote counts in real-time.”
- “Generate a Python app that uses a Heroku Key-Value Store instance for caching.”

### Managing add-ons

You can view attached add-ons within the Vibes UI. Full management capabilities, such as upgrading plans or removing add-ons, are available in the Heroku Dashboard after you [transfer the app](#4-transfer-your-app).

## Quotas and limits

To ensure a fair and stable experience for everyone, we have usage quotas in place:

- **Message limit for unverified users**: Receive up to 15 free messages per week.
- **Message limit for verified users**: Receive up to 30 free messages per week to build and iterate more.
- **Project limit**: All users can work on up to 3 projects at a time. If you’re out of projects, [transfer an app](#4-transfer-your-app) to your Heroku account or delete a project to free up a project slot. Standard pricing and terms apply after transferring your app.

> To increase your message limit, [verify your account](#3-verify-your-account).

## Limited pilot considerations

Heroku Vibes is currently in a limited pilot, and we appreciate your feedback. Keep in mind:

- **Daily app generation limits**: To ensure a stable experience for all users, there's a limit on how many new apps Vibes can generate each day.
- **Read-only code**: Before transferring an app to your Heroku account, its code is view-only within Vibes. [Transfer your app](#4-transfer-your-app) to gain full editing capabilities.
