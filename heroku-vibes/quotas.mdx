description: "Understand message caps, project slots, and usage guidelines for the Vibes pilot."

Heroku Vibes runs in a controlled pilot to ensure stability. Keep these limits in mind as you build.

## Message quotas

| Account status | Messages per week | How to increase |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unverified | 15 | Verify your account (free) to double the quota. |
| Verified | 30 | Contact Heroku Support if your team needs higher limits. |

Messages include prompts and follow-up instructions. Deleting a project does not restore messages consumed for that week.

## Project slots

- **3 active projects** per workspace.
- Transfer or delete a project to free a slot.
- Transferring spins up a Basic dyno in your account and does not consume project slots.

## App generation limits

- Daily caps protect shared infrastructure. If you hit a cap, wait until the next UTC day or contact Support with your use case.
- Extremely long prompts may be truncated; break work into smaller iterations for best results.

## Runtime characteristics

- Temporary apps run on Eco dynos. They may sleep after periods of inactivity.
- After transfer, the app runs on a Basic dyno (`$7/month`) by default. Adjust the plan to match your workload.

## Support channels

- Runtime or deployment issues: [Heroku Support](https://help.heroku.com)
- Product feedback: `heroku-ai-feedback@salesforce.com`

Respecting these limits keeps the pilot reliable for everyone while we scale capacity.
