Heroku Vibes provisions add-ons automatically when you mention them in your prompt. This lets you prototype with real data and infrastructure from the first iteration.

## Supported add-ons

| Add-on | Prompt hints | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Heroku Postgres | “Attach a standard-0 Postgres database” | Vibes sets `DATABASE_URL` and migrates basic schemas as needed. |
| Heroku Key-Value Store | “Use Redis for caching session data” | Configures `REDIS_URL` and installs the adapter for the detected language. |
| Heroku Data for Redis (legacy) | “Connect to Redis premium” | Consider Key-Value Store for new projects. |
| Any marketplace add-on | “Provision Papertrail for logs” | Vibes executes `heroku addons:create` with default plans unless you specify one. |

## Prompting tips

- Specify the plan tier if cost matters (for example, `standard-0`, `basic`, `eco`).
- Mention the integration point (“store signups in Postgres”, “cache API responses in Redis”).
- Request sample data to see the schema in action.

## Inspecting add-ons

Within Vibes you can view which add-ons were attached. After transfer:

1. Run `heroku addons -a YOUR-APP-NAME` to list services.
2. Use the add-on dashboard (for example, Heroku Postgres) to inspect tables or metrics.

## Extending integrations

Once the project is in your account:

- Scale add-ons to production tiers.
- Add private networking or Shield features if compliance requires it.
- Combine with other services (Search, MQ, observability) using the standard Heroku CLI.

Prototyping with real services ensures your app architecture translates cleanly when you move past the pilot stage.
