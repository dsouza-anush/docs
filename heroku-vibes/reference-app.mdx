Use the [pizzaz-mcp-heroku](https://github.com/dsouza-anush/pizzaz-mcp-heroku) repository to study how Vibes and MCP work together end-to-end. It includes:

- A Python-based MCP server using FastMCP.
- Five interactive widgets rendered as HTML/JS iframes.
- A Deploy to Heroku button for one-click setup.
- Documentation for connecting the server to ChatGPT (Apps SDK) or Claude.

## Deploy the sample

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dsouza-anush/pizzaz-mcp-heroku.git
cd pizzaz-mcp-heroku
heroku create my-vibes-sample
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/python
git push heroku main
```

After deployment, the manifest lives at `https://my-vibes-sample.herokuapp.com/.well-known/mcp.json`.

## Explore the code

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `server/tools/` | MCP tool definitions—see how widgets return metadata. |
| `widgets/` | HTML, CSS, and JS assets rendered inside ChatGPT. |
| `app.json` | Heroku app definition for review apps/pipelines. |

## Extend for your use case

- Fork the repo and swap the pizza-themed content for your product data.
- Add new widgets by copying the pattern in `widgets/` and updating the tool manifest.
- Deploy multiple variants using Heroku Pipelines and review apps to test changes before promoting them.

This sample is the fastest way to understand the architecture behind Vibes and build confidence before customizing your own MCP server or widgets.
