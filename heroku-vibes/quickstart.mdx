Follow these steps to move from a prompt to a running application in minutes.

## 1. Sign in

1. Visit [vibes.heroku.com](https://vibes.heroku.com).
2. Click **Sign In** and authenticate with your Heroku or Google account.
3. Accept the pilot terms. You now have a personal workspace and three project slots.

## 2. Describe your app

Use natural language to capture the product you want. Be specific about:

- Framework or runtime (for example, “Node.js with Express” or “Ruby on Rails”).
- Data requirements (Postgres, Key-Value Store, third-party APIs).
- UI expectations (landing page, dashboard, authentication, etc.).

**Example**

> "Build a Node.js Express app called LaunchPad with a tailwind-styled landing page, a simple signup form, and a Postgres database for storing subscribers."

Vibes creates a to-do list and begins implementing each task. The right-hand preview updates as the agent completes steps.

## 3. Iterate in conversation

Use follow-up prompts to refine the app:

- “Add a pricing section with two tiers.”
- “Connect the signup form to the Postgres table.”
- “Swap the color palette to purple and white.”

Each prompt triggers a new task list and updates the preview. You can always roll back or delete the project without affecting your quota.

## 4. Explore the preview

- Click **Open App** to view the running dyno in a new window.
- Use the preview panel to test forms, navigate pages, and validate data writes.
- Download the activity log for a narrativized history of the prompts and responses.

## 5. Verify & transfer (optional)

Once you’re happy with the prototype, verify your account to unlock transfers and additional messages. Then transfer the project into your Heroku account and continue development with git.

Continue with [account verification & transfer](/heroku-vibes/account) for the detailed steps.
