description: "Unlock higher quotas and move Vibes projects into your own Heroku account." 
---

During the pilot, all projects run inside a temporary Heroku tenant. When you are ready to take ownership, verify your account and transfer the project.

## Verify your account

1. Click **Get verified** in the Vibes header.
2. Authenticate with your Heroku credentials.
3. Add a payment method if your account doesn’t have one. (Verification is free—charges apply only after transfer when a Basic dyno is provisioned.)
4. Confirmation unlocks a higher weekly message quota and the ability to transfer apps.

## Transfer a project

1. Open the project you want to keep.
2. Click **Transfer to Heroku**.
3. Choose the destination Heroku account (the verified account you authenticated above).
4. Confirm. Vibes creates a new app in your account with:
   - The generated source code in a git repository.
   - Any provisioned add-ons (for example, Postgres, Key-Value Store).
   - Config vars required by the app.
   - A Basic dyno (`$7/month`) running the latest build.

## Continue development

- Clone the repo locally:

  ```bash
  heroku git:clone -a YOUR-APP-NAME
  ```

- Use `heroku logs --tail` to monitor runtime behavior.
- Scale dynos or attach additional add-ons just like any other Heroku app.

## Free up project slots

Each Vibes workspace supports three active projects. After transferring, delete the temporary project to free a slot:

1. In Vibes, open the project menu.
2. Click the trash icon and confirm deletion.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Verification prompts for payment method | Add a card in the Heroku Dashboard → Account → Billing. |
| Transfer fails with permission error | Ensure you’re signed into the correct Heroku account and have the **Deploy** permission for the target team/app space. |
| App not visible after transfer | Refresh the Heroku Dashboard or run `heroku apps` to list all apps under your account. |
