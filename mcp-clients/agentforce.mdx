Agentforce (Salesforce’s generative AI platform) can call external MCP servers. Host your tools on Heroku and register the manifest in Salesforce so custom agents can invoke them alongside CRM data.

## Prerequisites

- Access to Agentforce with the **Model Context Protocol** feature enabled.
- A Heroku MCP server with a public manifest (for example `https://your-app.herokuapp.com/.well-known/mcp.json`).
- Salesforce credentials with permission to manage Connected Apps.

## Register the manifest

1. From Salesforce Setup, open **Agentforce → Tools → MCP Integrations**.
2. Click **New MCP Server** and supply:
   - **Name**: descriptive label (for example `Heroku Deploy Tools`).
   - **Manifest URL**: the Heroku `/.well-known/mcp.json` endpoint.
   - **Authentication**: API key or OAuth details, if your server requires auth.
3. Save the integration. Salesforce fetches the manifest and validates tool definitions.

## Attach to an agent

1. Open the Agentforce builder for the agent you want to enhance.
2. In **Tools**, add the MCP integration you created (for example, `Heroku Deploy Tools`).
3. Configure prompts or guardrails so the agent knows when to call each tool.
4. Test the agent in the preview console; Heroku logs show tool invocations in real time.

## Best practices

- Use Salesforce Shield or Named Credentials to store sensitive auth tokens securely.
- Keep tool responses structured—Agentforce agents can map JSON output into flows or records.
- Monitor invocation metrics in Salesforce and Heroku to maintain reliability SLA targets.
- Combine MCP tools with Agentforce’s CRM grounding so assistants can reason over Salesforce data while executing Heroku automation.
