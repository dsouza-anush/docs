Cursor supports MCP so you can call your Heroku tools directly from the editor when writing or reviewing code.

## Connect your server

1. Deploy your MCP server to Heroku and copy the manifest URL (`https://your-app.herokuapp.com/.well-known/mcp.json`).
2. In Cursor, open **Settings → AI → MCP**.
3. Click **Add MCP Server**, paste the manifest URL, and provide any auth token or header required by your server.
4. Save. Your tools appear under the MCP palette (`⌘ ⇧ P` / `Ctrl Shift P`) and are available in chat completions.

## Workflow ideas

- Generate scaffolding from internal templates, lint custom rules, or run deployment checks without leaving the editor.
- Combine Cursor’s “autofix” command with MCP tools to run Heroku CLIs, inspect logs, or query staging environments.
- Use Heroku Pipelines review apps to create per-branch MCP endpoints for QA.

## Tips

- Keep tooling idempotent—Cursor may call a tool multiple times while refining output.
- Stream responses for long-running operations so developers see incremental status inside Cursor.
- Monitor usage with `heroku logs --tail` to tune latency and identify commands that need caching.
