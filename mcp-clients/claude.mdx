Claude implements MCP for both the desktop client and Anthropic’s Agents API. Point Claude at your Heroku manifest to unlock custom tools in conversations.

## Claude Desktop

1. Deploy your MCP server to Heroku and note the manifest URL (`https://your-app.herokuapp.com/.well-known/mcp.json`).
2. Open the Claude Desktop config file:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/resources/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%AppData%\\Claude\\resources\\claude_desktop_config.json`
3. Add an entry under `mcpServers`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "heroku-tools": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://your-app.herokuapp.com/.well-known/mcp.json",
      "auth": {
        "type": "basic",
        "username": "$MCP_USER",
        "password": "$MCP_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Claude Desktop. Your tools appear in the MCP panel when you start a new chat.

## Claude.ai / Workbench

- Upload the manifest in **Settings → Tools & Integrations → Model Context Protocol**.
- Alternatively, attach MCP servers when running the [Anthropic Agents API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents):

```json
{
  "agent_id": "agent_123",
  "input": "Investigate the latest release in staging.",
  "mcp": {
    "servers": [
      {
        "name": "heroku-tools",
        "type": "remote",
        "url": "https://your-app.herokuapp.com/.well-known/mcp.json"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Claude automatically loads the manifest and invokes your tools during the agent run.

## Tips

- Use [prompt caching](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) for large system prompts—Anthropic supports caching per-tool.
- Track tool usage via Heroku logs to understand invocation frequency and errors.
- Combine with the [MCP integration cookbook](/cookbook/mcp-integrations) for end-to-end deployment patterns.
