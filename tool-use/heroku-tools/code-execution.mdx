The built-in code execution tools mirror the MCP templates highlighted in [Working with MCP](/tool-use/working-with-mcp). They let agents run small scripts inside one-off dynos—without maintaining a separate MCP server—using the same execution model as the open-source templates.

## Supported runtimes

| Tool | Runtime | Matching MCP template |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `code_exec_ruby` | Ruby with Gemfile support | [mcp-code-exec-ruby](https://github.com/heroku/mcp-code-exec-ruby) |
| `code_exec_python` | Python with pip packages | [mcp-code-exec-python](https://github.com/heroku/mcp-code-exec-python) |
| `code_exec_go` | Go modules | [mcp-code-exec-go](https://github.com/heroku/mcp-code-exec-go) |
| `code_exec_node` | Node.js with npm packages | [mcp-code-exec-node](https://github.com/heroku/mcp-code-exec-node) |

Use the table to decide whether the built-in tool is sufficient or if you need to fork the corresponding template for additional customization.

## Usage

Provide the language (`python`, `ruby`, `node`, `go`) and source code. The tool returns stdout, stderr, and the exit status. Keep executions short—long-running jobs should be promoted to a dedicated dyno or background worker.

## Example prompt

```
Run this Python code that sums numbers 1 through 10.
```

## Best practices

- Validate input before execution to avoid unintended side effects.
- Keep scripts idempotent—agents may retry on errors.
- Log execution metadata (`target_app_name`, timestamps) for auditing.
- When you need more control, deploy your own MCP server using the templates above.
