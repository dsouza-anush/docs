title: "Code execution"
description: "Run language-specific code securely via Heroku tools."

The code execution tool allows agents to run short scripts within a sandboxed environment. Use it for debugging, data transformation, or script automation without leaving the conversation.

## Usage

Provide the language (`python`, `ruby`, `node`, `go`) and source code. The tool returns stdout, stderr, and the exit status. Limit execution to quick tasks—long-running jobs should move to dedicated dynos.

## Example prompt

```
Run this Python code that sums numbers 1 through 10.
```

## Best practices

- Validate input before execution to avoid unintended side effects.
- Keep scripts idempotent—agents may retry on errors.
- Log execution metadata (`target_app_name`, timestamps) for auditing.
