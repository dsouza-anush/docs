The doc reader tool ingests documentation, markdown files, or knowledge base articles so agents can answer questions with citations. Provide the document path or content and the tool returns relevant excerpts.

## Use cases

- Onboarding FAQs for internal teams
- API reference lookups
- Troubleshooting guides with step-by-step instructions

## Example prompt

```
Summarize the deployment steps from our Heroku onboarding guide.
```

## Best practices

- Keep documents scoped to a topic to improve accuracy.
- Update the stored content regularly to avoid stale answers.
- Combine with code execution or SQL tools to produce actionable responses.
