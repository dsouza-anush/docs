title: "Doc reader"
description: "Summarize and answer questions from documentation stored in Heroku." 
---

The doc reader mirrors the [mcp-doc-reader](https://github.com/heroku/mcp-doc-reader) template covered in [Working with MCP](/tool-use/working-with-mcp). It ingests documentation, markdown files, or knowledge base articles so agents can answer questions with citations—without the need to deploy your own MCP server.

## Use cases

- Onboarding FAQs for internal teams
- API reference lookups
- Troubleshooting guides with step-by-step instructions

## Example prompt

```
Summarize the deployment steps from our Heroku onboarding guide.
```

## Best practices

- Keep documents scoped to a topic to improve accuracy.
- Update the stored content regularly to avoid stale answers.
- Combine with code execution or SQL tools to produce actionable responses.
- When you need more control over parsing (HTML, PDF, etc.), fork the `mcp-doc-reader` template and deploy it as a dedicated MCP server.
