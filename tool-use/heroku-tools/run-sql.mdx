---

Use the `pg_psql` tool to run SQL against a Heroku Postgres database attached to your app. The tool returns query results as JSON, making it easy to answer analytical questions or power dashboards.

## Requirements

- `target_app_name` pointing to the Heroku app with the database
- Appropriate database credentials configured via config vars

## Example prompt

```
Query the database for the top 5 customers by annual recurring revenue.
```

## Tips

- Use parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection.
- Limit result sets to keep responses manageable.
- Combine with the doc reader to explain table schemas before querying.
