## Use Cases and Benefits

AI Studio supports AI development, from model experimentation to integration:

- Understand model nuances: Experiment with different prompts and parameters to understand the capabilities of the [model](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-inference-api-model-cards) you provisioned.

- Tune prompts: Tune and refine prompts for your application before you implement them. Tuning enables you to iterate on your text and instructions without frequently redeploying code.

- Manage tool use: Verify which tools are effective for your use case, so you can receive reliable and expected outputs.

- Streamline integration: Integrate validated prompts and configurations into your app’s code with the help of built-in guidance and code snippets.

## Get Started with AI Studio

To access AI Studio:

- Open the [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

- Select the app that has the Managed Inference and Agents add-on attached.

- Select the `Resources` tab.

- Select `Heroku Managed Inference and Agents` under `Add-on Services`. If you don’t have the add-on yet, use the search bar to find and add the Heroku Managed Inference and Agents add-on.

- Select `Open Playground`.

## Using AI Studio

You can use the chat function in Heroku AI Studio to ask questions, analyze data, and get general help with Heroku apps. AI Studio can help with a variety of tasks, like analyzing app performance, debugging production issues, and optimizing configurations.

You can change `Parameters` to guide the AI’s behavior and responses:

- System Prompt: instructions that guide the AI’s behavior and responses

- Temperature: sets the randomness of responses

- Top-p: nucleus sampling that limits the model to the most probable tokens

- Max tokens: sets response length

- Stop sequences: text patterns that stop generation immediately

When you chat with AI Studio, you can toggle `Agent Mode` on and off. Agent mode allows you to use tools. To enable Heroku tool use, click `Tools` in the upper-right corner. You can use tools for tasks like code execution, content conversion, computation, and database querying.

Select the moon (or sun) icon to switch between light and dark modes. Click `View code` to copy code snippets you can integrate into your app.
